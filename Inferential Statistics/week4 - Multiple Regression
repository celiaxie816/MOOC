##Part 1: Individual Tests of Predictors |||
# Vector containing the amount of money you gave participants (predictor)
money  <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Vector containing how much you smiled (predictor)
smile <- c(0.6, 0.7, 1.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9, 0.2)

# Vector containing the amount the participants liked you (response)
liking <- c(2.2, 2.8, 4.5, 3.1, 8.7, 5.0, 4.5, 8.8, 9.0, 9.2)

# Find the regression coefficients for liking, predicted by smile and money
lm(liking ~ smile + money)

# Assign the summary of lm(liking ~ smile + money) to 'mod1'
mod1 <- summary(lm(liking ~ smile + money))

# Print the R-squared of 'mod1'
mod1$r.squared

# Sum and square the residuals from lm(liking ~ smile + money), assign to object 'ssr'
ssr <- sum((lm(liking ~ smile + money)$residual)^2)

# Sum and square the value of mean liking - observed liking, assign to object 'sst'
sst <- sum((mean(liking) - liking)^2)

# Find the R squared as (sst - ssr)/sst
(sst - ssr) / sst

# Find the regression mean square
rms <- (sst - ssr) / 2
  
# Find the mean squared error
mse <- ssr / 7
  
# Use rms and mse to find the F statsitic
rms / mse

# Find confidence interval of fitted model
confint(mod, level = 0.9)

# Obtain the residuals from mod using $, assign to "resmod"
resmod <-summary(mod)$residuals

# Print the standardized residuals
resmod / sd(resmod)

# Plot the 'smile' on the x-axis, with the residuals on the y-axis
plot(smile, resmod)

# Plot the 'money' on the x-axis, with the residuals on the y-axis
plot(money, resmod)

# Plot the residuals in a histogram using hist()
hist(resmod)

# Vector containing what you said to participants (predictor)
talk <- c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1)

# Add "talk" to your regression model as a factor predictor
mod <- lm(liking ~ smile + money + as.factor(talk))

# Apply the logistic regression model to our data using glm(), assign to logmod
logmod <- glm(liking ~ money + smile, family = binomial)

# Find the regression coefficients for our regression model using summary()
summary(logmod)
