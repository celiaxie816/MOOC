week6 - Non-parametric Test

##Part 1:The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
#' test the hypothesis that there is an equal number of american citizens voting for 
#' Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders
binom.test(210,350,p=0.5,alternative = "two.sided")

#' State your conclusion in the variable conclusion. Assign it either the value of "rejected"
#' or the value of "accepted"
conclusion <- "rejected"

# do a Wilcoxon test
wilcox.test(score_ipa, score_wheat, alternative = 'greater', paired = TRUE)

# assign your conclusion to the variable conclusion
conclusion <- "rejected"


##Part 2:The Wilcoxon rank-sum test
# do a Wilcoxon rank-sum test
wilcox.test(beer_data$rating ~ beer_data$group, alternative = "greater")

# assign your conclusion to the variable conclusion
conclusion <- "rejected"


##Part 3:Kruskal-Wallis Test
# do a Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(rating ~ group, data = beer_data)


# assign your conclusion to the variable conclusion
conclusion <- "not"


##Part 4:Spearman Coefficients
# calculate the spearman correlation between education level and rating of craft beer
cor(beer_data$education_level, beer_data$consumption, method = "spearman")

# calculate the correlation coefficient and test whether it is different from 0
cor.test(beer_data$education_level, beer_data$consumption, method = "spearman")

# is the null hypothesis accepted or rejected. Assign either value to the variable conclusion
conclusion <- "rejected"
